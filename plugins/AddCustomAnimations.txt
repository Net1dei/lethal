import mixamo animations workflow
for DanceOff mod by TDP

1. Make unity project
recommended version: 2022.3.9f1
recommended project: 3D (HDRP)
import "customanim.unitypackage"

2. Get animation
upload "lcsuitoriginalsimplerig.fbx" to mixamo
choose animation
download
import to unity project

3. Convert animation
open "importanimcontroller"
add imported animation (probably called "mixamo.com")
go to "animationsbundle/DanceOff" folder
create new AnimationClip and name it whatever your animation is called
at the bottom of the inspector window assign the AnimationClip to AssetBundle "animationsbundle"
-
open "AnimationConvert" scene
select "bind player -> ScavengerModel -> metarig" in scene
add created AnimationClip to "Record Anim" script
press play and wait for animation to end
both models should be performing your downloaded animation
as soon as it ends exit play mode
(for some reason the legs might not move but don't worry they will in the converted animation)
clear the AnimationScript reference in "Record Anim" script so it won't overwrite again by accident

4. Export animation
open "animatorbundle/Controller" folder
open "DanceOffMetarigLocal.controller" and go to "EmotesNoArms" layer
replace an animation with your new AnimationClip from "animationsbundles/newanims"
to make the animation loop, make a transition from the "Dance?" state to itself and tweak it as needed
open "DanceOffMetarigOthers.controller" and do the same
(Dance1 is Emote1, Dance2 is Emote2, etc.)
-
in the menu bar at the top of the unity editor click "Build AssetBundles" in "AssetBundles" tab
(you may have to wait a minute)
open "DanceOff/Built AssetBundles" folder in windows explorer
copy "animationsbundle" and "animatorbundle"
go to DanceOff mod folder location
(<Lethal Company or mod profile folder>/BepInEx/plugins/DanceOff)
delete existing assetbundles in "Animations" folder
paste new assetbundles in "Animations" folder

5. Done
start the game and press the corresponding keybind
your animation should now play
everyone in your lobbies need the same assetbundles to see the same animations
I hope it works for you <3
